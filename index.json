[{"categories":null,"contents":"While migrating my local users to oidc I accidentally removed admin privileges on the built-in admin user\u0026hellip; This made continuing the migration difficult since i was unable to access the admin features of NextCloud. Here\u0026rsquo;s a short description of how I rescued my privileges.\nTo give your user admin privileges you have to edit the NextCloud database. If you are running the NextCloud AIO you can access the database using the following command.\nsudo docker exec -it nextcloud-aio-database psql -U oc_nextcloud nextcloud_database\nThere are three databases you have should know of\noc_users\nThis table contains the local users. oc_groups\nThis table contains the groups. oc_group_user\nAnd this table contains the groups a given user is a part of. For example, to get a list of your users you could run the following command:\nnextcloud_database=\u0026gt; SELECT * FROM oc_users; uid | displayname | password | uid_lower -------+-------------+----------------+----------- admin | | redacted ;) | admin (1 row) To add the local admin user to the local admin group you can run the following command:\n-- This starts a new transaction. It is not needed but I would recommend using -- it since it will help you if you make a mistake. BEGIN; -- Inserts the values into the database. INSERT INTO oc_group_user VALUES (\u0026#39;admin\u0026#39;,\u0026#39;admin\u0026#39;); -- This commits the transaction. Nothing will be changed until this command -- is run. Verify that the previous commands have done what you expect before -- running it. If there is something wrong you can run ROLLBACK; instead. COMMIT; You should just be able to reload the NextCloud interface and the admin interface will show up.\nYou can easily apply this to any user and group you have in your environment just change the first admin to the group and the 2nd to your user.\n","date":"January 7, 2024","hero":"/images/logos/nextcloud-hero.png","permalink":"https://www.vestern.se/posts/homelab/nextcloud_rescue_admin_permissions/","summary":"While migrating my local users to oidc I accidentally removed admin privileges on the built-in admin user\u0026hellip; This made continuing the migration difficult since i was unable to access the admin features of NextCloud.

I thought i would document the process for future reference and if this helps someone else perform a migration like this, that\u0026rsquo;s a nice bonus.\nPre migration tasks Before performing any big changes like this you should backup everything. I did this in two ways.\nI started by using the AIO interface to create a backup of NextCloud. Remember to save the backup password. Then i created a snapshot of my NextCloud host so that i could perform a rollback on the entire host if needed. The NextCloud storage was not on this machine therefore it was not included in the snapshot. Migration Log in to the AIO interface and stop all containers. Stop the AIO master-container\nsudo docker stop nextcloud-aio-mastercontainer Take a snapshot of your host or perform a backup in some other way. This might include copying the docker volume directory (/var/lib/docker/volumes/) to another host. Copy your files while preserving the permissions\nsudo rsync -aP /path/to/NextCloudData /path/to/new/directory/\nThis will create the directory NextCloudData under directory. -a: Tells rsync to perform an archive copy. This preserves the important meta information like owner and permissions. -P: Tells rsync to print progress. Remove the master container\nsudo docker rm nextcloud-aio-mastercontainer Recreate the master container using your initial method but with the new directory set as the NEXTCLOUD_DATADIR=/path/to/new/directory/NextCloudData. I used my ansible role docker-nextcloud-aio. Log in to AIO container and start all containers. Log in to your NextCloud and make sure everything works. Post Migration The data is now migrated to the new location and the master-container holds the information of where to find the data. You might want to perform the same migration on your backup directory, though you should not save your user-data and backups in the same place.\nConclusion This migration was a lot easier than the documentation made it seem. I would be happy to see some official instructions in the documentation but i guess this is not something they want you to do since you could ruin your NextCloud setup.\n","date":"January 7, 2024","hero":"/images/logos/nextcloud-hero.png","permalink":"https://www.vestern.se/posts/homelab/nextcloud_migrate_aio_datadir/","summary":"When I faced the issue of migrating the storage directory for my AIO NextCloud the official README sent me to a github discussion whit a somewhat vague answer on how to perform the migration.
